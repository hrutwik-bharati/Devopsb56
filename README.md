Introduction(Experienced)
“Hi, my name is Abhipray Dhoble. I’m currently working as a DevOps Engineer at Greamio Technologies, with around 3 years of experience in automating infrastructure, managing CI/CD pipelines, and working with various DevOps and cloud technologies.

In my current role, I’ve been:

Building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, integrating it with tools like Git, Maven, and SonarQube to automate builds, tests, and deployments.

Automating infrastructure provisioning using Terraform on AWS, working with services like EC2, IAM, S3, VPC, EBS, CloudWatch, Elastic Load Balancer, Auto Scaling Groups, Route 53, and CloudTrail.

Managing EKS for Kubernetes-based deployments, including services, pods, ingress, and troubleshooting containerized workloads.

Writing Ansible playbooks for server provisioning and configuration automation.

Setting up monitoring and observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and log management using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

Working across Linux environments like Ubuntu, Red Hat, and CentOS for server administration.

On the Linux side, I handle:

User and group management, file permissions, disk partitioning, cron jobs, systemd services, and log analysis.

Real-time performance monitoring using top, htop, and iostat, and troubleshooting network and process-related issues.

Managing services like SSH, FTP, NFS, and configuring Apache, Nginx, and Tomcat servers.

I also ensure infrastructure is secure and scalable by configuring Security Groups, NACLs, Internet/NAT Gateways, and DNS using Route 53.
Introduction(Fresher):
“Hi, my name is Abhipray Dhoble. I’m currently working as a DevOps Intern at Cloudblitz Technologies, where I’m gaining hands-on experience with AWS services, Linux system administration, and modern DevOps practices.

Over the last few months, I’ve been involved in tasks like:

Managing AWS infrastructure using services like EC2, IAM, S3, VPC, CloudWatch, and Route 53.

Creating basic CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, integrated with Git, Maven, and SonarQube for build and code quality automation.

Automating infrastructure using Terraform, and writing Ansible playbooks for server and application configuration.

Working on containerization and orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes (EKS).

Using Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring, and the ELK stack for log analysis.

Alongside my internship, I’ve completed personal DevOps projects to strengthen my skills:

Deployed a Netflix clone and Myntra clone using a full CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

Built and deployed a Mario game application using ArgoCD for GitOps-style delivery on Kubernetes.

Practiced infrastructure setup using Terraform to provision secure and scalable environments on AWS.

From a Linux perspective, I’m comfortable with tasks like user and group management, file permissions, disk partitioning, cron jobs, process monitoring, and service configurations on Ubuntu and CentOS systems.
